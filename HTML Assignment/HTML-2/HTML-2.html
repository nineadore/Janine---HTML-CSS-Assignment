    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m Janine T. Adores, a 19-year-old from Valenzuela City. Currently, I’m a 2nd-year student at PUP Manila, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. I’m an ambivert with a bubbly personality, and I have a soft spot for cute things—especially cats!</p>
    <p>I aspire to become a skilled Front-End Web Developer, bringing creative designs and ideas to life. At the same time, I’m also eager to explore other exciting areas in tech, particularly Security and Networking, as I believe it’s important to grow and broaden my skills in the ever-evolving world of IT.</p>
    <p>I’m passionate about learning, staying curious, and taking on opportunities that help me grow personally and professionally.</p>

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I love spending my free time watching YouTube tutorials to improve my skills in web development. Aside from that, I enjoy participating in workshops about Security and Networking to expand my knowledge in these fields. I’m also passionate about diving into creative projects, exploring new ideas, and unwinding through my favorite activities.</p>
    <p>When it comes to movies, I have a soft spot for 2000s romantic comedies—they never fail to make me smile. I’m also a huge fan of Taylor Swift’s music, and my favorite album of hers is folklore, which I find beautifully poetic and soothing.</p>
    <p>As a music lover, I also love singing, and one of my all-time favorite artists is Mariah Carey. Her incredible vocal range and timeless hits always inspire me.</p>
    <p>In the world of gaming, I used to be a good player in Crossfire, but right now, I’m mostly playing Fall Guys, Minecraft, and GTA San Andreas. These games fuel my creativity and provide a fun way to relax.</p>
