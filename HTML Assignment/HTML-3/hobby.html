    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

    <h3>1. Listening to Music</h3>
    <p>I’m a music lover, and Taylor Swift is one of my favorite artists. Her lyrics and musical versatility always inspire me, and her albums, especially *folklore*, resonate deeply with me.</p>

    <div style = "margin-left: 60px;">Taylor Swift</div>

    <h3>2. Watching YouTube Tutorials</h3>
    <p>I enjoy watching full courses on HTML and CSS on YouTube, especially from the Bro Code channel. It helps me improve my web development skills.</p>

    <h3>3. Watching Movies and Series</h3>
    <p>I’m a huge fan of the Twilight Saga. I love the mix of romance, fantasy, and drama, and it’s one of those movie series I can watch over and over again without getting tired of it. I know some of y’all might find this movie cringey or corny, but I really enjoy the storyline and the acting. It’s funny at times, and despite the memes and critiques, I still find myself wanting to watch it again and again.</p>

    <h3>4. Playing Games</h3>
    <p>I love playing Minecraft. It lets me unleash my creativity, whether I’m building intricate structures, exploring new worlds, or just relaxing with friends in the game. It’s the perfect way to unwind while still having fun!</p>
